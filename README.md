# Kleenex pollen radar / Scottex

This is a custom integration of the Kleenex pollen radar/Scottex. It will provide information about pollen counts and levels for trees, grass and weeds. Information will only be available for positions in the Netherlands, United Kingdom, France, Italy and United States of America as Kleenex/Scottex only provides information for these countries.

## Installation

Via HACS:

- Search for Kleenex Pollen Radar

## Setup

During the setup of the integration a region, name, city or latitude and longitude needs to be provided.

## What to expect

The following sensors will be registered:

- Tree pollen
- Tree pollen level
- Grass pollen
- Grass pollen level
- Weeds pollen
- Weeds pollen level
- Date

Next to these sensors, for every type of tree/grass/weeds pollen two sensors will be created, one for value and one for level.

The tree/grass/weeds pollen sensors have additional attributes for the forecast for the upcoming 4 days.

The sensor information is updated every hour although the values on the Kleenex pollen radar website are usually updated every 3 hours.

Finally a diagnostic sensor called Last Updated (Pollen) which contains the date and time of the last update.

## Dashboard examples

Ronald v/d Brink created nice dashboard examples related to this integration. Please take a look at [vdbrink]

## Trouble shooting

If the Kleenex integration raises errors then first have a look at the Kleenex/Scottex website and check the pollen radar there:

[^1]: The USA version of the Kleenex pollen radar uses a different version of the API, which is incompatible with the integration. This integration uses an older version of the Kleenex/Scottex API. As a result, the pollen values shown in Home Assistant may differ from those displayed on the official website.
